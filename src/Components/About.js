        <p>I believe we all have the ability to create and express ourselves in a various amounbt of ways. Over the past couple of months, my form of expression has become music. It's something that brings me a sense of purpose and allows me to be myself, while also puttin gthe thoughts I have in my head to use. I've found something I'm passionate about and I'm enjoying myself while doing it. I've met some amazing people that play vital roles in the creation of my content and I would'nt be able to do any of this without them.</p>
